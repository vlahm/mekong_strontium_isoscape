two models. one for conc, one for iso. the conc one requires slope and temp, because those affect conc. try just the isotope model first. if that doesnt do well, then consider conc + slope + temp

could weight by overland flow * predicted stront conc. youd first need rock type. carbonate/silicate

spatial weighting by area is last resort
look for precipitation data by region too. that would be better. do the above if im feeling swanky

two clement models: erosion and no (both of these are from clement)
these remain distinct throughout. just want to see which one performs better

standard practice:
want weighted mean isotope ratio at each prediciton and ovservation site
get that by computing mean iso ratio of ech rca
accumulate those downstream
something about dividing that accumulation column by a column of accumulated upstream area

slope, temp, stront conc
strong iso (clement data)
