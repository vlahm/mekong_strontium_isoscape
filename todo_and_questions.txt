how to associate erosion/no erosion sr data with prediction points (right now theyre only associated with edges, so cant be used for modeling)
    with watershed attributes tool
    first gotta get rcaAreaKm2 and h2oAreaKm2 associated with edges
    then use these in watershed attributes tool to create a new field in sites feature classes called h2oAreaKm2
    then create srEro_prod (sr_ero * rcaAreaKm2), accumulate it to make srEro_acc, then do srEro_wtd = srEro_acc / h2oAreaKm2
    then you can put srEro_acc and srEro_prod in the watershed attributes tool just like you did with rcaAreaKm2 and h2oAreaKm2
    then srEro_acc will be associated with sites and preds, so within the sites and preds attribute tables you can do acc/h2oAreaKm2
    then do it all again for NoEro

project to gcs so plots will have lat long

fix plot legend
